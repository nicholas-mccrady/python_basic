# python_basic
This project is a demonstration of all core python concepts and modules

first we created a git hub repository using a python git ignore and we included a read me.
next we need to run the command "git config --global credential.helper wincred" (this identifies your maching and you wont be able to do commits without running it)
next we need to open a git bash terminal to the directory or folder that we want our project to be cloned to 
next we cloned the repository to our work enviroment using command "git clone (copy and paste web site url here)" noting that we double checked that our work went to the proper directory or folder that we wanted to work in 
then we want to open the project folder and we want to view the hiddent items so that we can see the git ignore folder
next

# any number in python that has a decimal point and most other languages is called a float
# mostly it refers to any number with a decimal point and the fact that it can occur at any position in the
# number.

# a floating number
my_floating_number = 2.0

# doing math with a floating number
my_second_floating_number = 3.0
first_result = my_floating_number + my_second_floating_number
print (first_result)

# beware that some mathmatic operations will produce unexpected results and to program accordingly
unexpected_number1 = 0.2
unexpected_number2 = 0.1
unexpected_result = unexpected_number1 + unexpected_number2
print (unexpected_result)
# note that this operation produces alot of decimal places on the out put and this is due to python trying to 
# represent the number as acuratly as it can

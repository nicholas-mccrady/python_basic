# numbers represent a large portion of functional programing such as to keep a score in a game or to
# represent visual data in all sorts of programs and applications

# first up is integers and their associated operations that you can do with them
# addition
addition = 2 + 3
print("addition of 2 + 3:",addition)

# subtraction
subtraction = 3-2
print("subtraction of 3 - 2:",subtraction)

# multiplication
multiplication = 2 * 3
print("multiplication of 2 * 3:",multiplication)

# division
division = 3/2
print("division of 3 / 2:",division)

# python also supports order of operations as well note that there is a operator precedence as well
# which is similar in concept but different in execution and will be covered in later topics

# basic order of operations in python are as follows:
# parenthesis , exponentiation , multiplication , division , addition , subtraction

#order of operations
order_of_operations = 2 + 3 * 4
print("order of operations 2 + 3 * 4:",order_of_operations)
second_order_operations = (2 + 3) * 4
print("order of operations ( 2 + 3 ) * 4:",second_order_operations)

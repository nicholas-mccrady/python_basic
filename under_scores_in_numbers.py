# when you are writing long numbers in python it can help to put an underscore in the number to make
# the program more readable
# note that python will ignore these underscores and that they are just an aesthetic to make numbers readable
# final not that ending a number with a underscore will produce an error

#wrong_underscore_number = 13_000_
#print(wrong_underscore_number)

my_big_number = 12_000_000
print(my_big_number)
